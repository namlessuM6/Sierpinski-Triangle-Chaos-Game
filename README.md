# Sierpinski-Triangle-Chaos-Game

Upon running program press the start button
Program takes user input for which level they wish to play. the number inputted will determine the ammout of triangles

pressing the red, blue, or green buttons will move the controller around the triangle, the goal is to get to the highlighted triangle in as few moves as possible.


# Future implementations

No triangles can be highlighted currently, so there is no goal yet.
if a user inputs a number higher then 9 it will take a very long time to draw all of the triangles on your screen.
